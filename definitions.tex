    Duty Cycle              
    & Duty cycle is the ratio of average power to peak power.
    A low duty cycle would indicate low average power and high peak power.
    The low average power is desirable from the standpoint of equipment size and the high peak power is important for maximum return signal strength.

	Radar Mode              & Any change in the characteristics of a signal transmitted from an emitter.                                                                                                                                \\ \hline

	Jamming effectiveness   & The efficacy of jamming waveforms in interfering with radar detection to decrease the probability of detection of the platform enough to impede detection without causing any suspicion.                  \\ \hline

    \Gls{tij} controller    & A jamming controlling methodology to gather measurements and make estimated predictions of the threat system and platform characteristics to develop the best suited jamming schedule in a time interval. \\ \hline

    Jamming coincidence     & The duration of time that a jammer is in a conflicting state and has to choose which threat to counter.\\ \hline

    Jamming profile        & The jamming pattern used against a single threat radar to inhibit detection.\\ \hline
