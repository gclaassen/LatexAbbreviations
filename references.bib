abstract = "One defender defends, and multiple heterogeneous attackers attack, an asset. Three scenarios are considered: the agents move simultaneously; the defender moves first; or the attackers move first. We show how the agents’ unit costs of defense and attack, their asset evaluations, and the number of attackers influence their investments, profits, and withdrawal decisions. Withdrawal does not occur in one-period (simultaneous) games between two agents, at least with the commonly used ratio-form contest success function, but can occur in two-period games between two agents. The presence of one particularly strong attacker can cause other attackers to withdraw from the contest if the advantaged attacker appropriates so much of the defender’s asset that it is no longer sufficiently attractive to interest other attackers. In such cases, the defender focuses exclusively on the strong attacker. An advantaged defender may be able to deter attacks by moving first, but will continue to suffer from attacks if moving second. This suggests the importance of proactive rather than reactive defense."

@article{Johnston1995,
abstract = {A survey of Chinese radars is presented. The survey shows that Chinese radars cover a wide spectrum of civilian and military applications. Chinese civilian radars include airborne weather avoidance/navigation, air traffic control, harbor surveillance, industrial applications, marine, meteorological/wind profilers, remote sensing, and space tracking. Military applications include airborne early warning, ground fire control, altimeters, battlefield surveillance, tactical 3-D, and 3-D phase scanning. Photographs and descriptions of Chinese radars are included, as well as derivative radars based on radars of other countries.},

abstract = "Mutual exclusion scheduling is the problem of scheduling unit-time tasks non-preemptively on m processors subject to constraints represented by a graph G, such that tasks represented by adjacent vertices in G must run in disjoint time intervals. This problem arises in load-balancing the parallel solution of partial differential equations by domain decomposition. Minimizing the completion time is NP-hard even if either the number of processors or the completion time is fixed but greater than two. However, polynomial time is sufficient to produce optimal schedules for forests, and simple heuristics perform well on certain classes of graphs. For graphs derived from the two-dimensional domain decomposition problem, heuristics yield solutions within 4c − 7 time units of optimal, where c is the maximal number of regions that touch each other at a single point in the domain decomposition; these solutions are within a constant factor of optimal."
